  - Send verification emails via SendGrid
  - Check username/email uniqueness across both Client and MakeupArtist tables
  - Handle case-insensitive email comparison
  - Continue signup even if email sending fails

### 5. Email Verification Flow ✓

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Configure SendGrid**
   - Set up SendGrid account and get API key
   - Configure sender authentication
   - Update SENDGRID_API_KEY and SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL in production env

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Consider adding rate limiting for signup attempts
   - Implement CAPTCHA for bot protection
   - Add password strength meter UI

3. **Email Templates**
   - Consider using SendGrid's dynamic templates for better email design
   - Add company branding to emails
   - Test email deliverability

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking for failed email sends
   - Monitor signup conversion rates
   - Track email verification rates

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

The implementation follows security best practices including:
- Email verification required before login
- Secure token generation
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Expiring verification tokens (24 hours)
- No user enumeration (generic messages for security)
