# Authentication System Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Install NextAuth.js (Auth.js) and OAuth provider packages
- ✅ Update Database Schema for OAuth providers (Client, MakeupArtist, Account, Session models)
- ✅ Configure Authentication Providers (Google, Facebook, Apple, Credentials)
- ✅ Create Authentication API Routes (/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts)
- ✅ Create Authentication Utilities (auth-helpers.ts with role-based access control)
- ✅ Create Login Pages for Client and Artist (separate login pages with SSO)
- ✅ Create Protected Dashboard Pages (client/dashboard and artist/dashboard)
- ✅ Implement Middleware for Route Protection (role-based routing)
- ✅ Update Environment Variables (.env.example with OAuth credentials)
- ✅ Create Authentication Components (SocialLoginButtons, LoginForm, LogoutButton)
- ✅ Run database migration (successfully applied schema changes)
- ✅ Create signup API endpoint for new user registration
- ✅ Add SessionProvider to app layout

## Pending Tasks (Testing)
- [ ] Create Unit Tests for Auth Utilities
- [ ] Create Unit Tests for Middleware
- [ ] Create Unit Tests for Auth Components
- [ ] Create Integration Tests
- [ ] Create API Route Tests

## Review of Changes

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- Installed NextAuth.js v5 (beta) with Prisma adapter
- Created custom Prisma adapter to handle separate Client and MakeupArtist models
- Implemented JWT-based session strategy for stateless authentication
- Added support for OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Apple) and credentials

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Made password fields optional to support OAuth users
- Added emailVerified field for email verification
- Created separate Account/Session models for Client and MakeupArtist
- Added proper indexes for performance

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Created separate login pages: `/auth/client/login` and `/auth/artist/login`
- Implemented role-based dashboards: `/client/dashboard` and `/artist/dashboard`
- Added middleware for automatic route protection and redirects
- Created unauthorized page for access control violations

### 4. Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- HttpOnly cookies for JWT tokens
- CSRF protection built into NextAuth
- Role-based access control at middleware level
- Secure session management with 30-day expiration

### 5. User Experience
- Social login buttons with loading states
- Form validation with error handling
- Automatic redirects based on user type
- Clean, responsive UI for all auth pages
- Logout functionality with loading state

## Next Steps for Production
1. Configure OAuth providers in respective developer consoles:
   - Google: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/
   - Apple: https://developer.apple.com/
2. Generate secure AUTH_SECRET: `openssl rand -base64 32`
3. Set up email verification flow (optional)
4. Implement rate limiting for login attempts
5. Add password reset functionality
6. Set up monitoring for failed login attempts

## Important Security Notes
- Never commit real OAuth credentials to version control
- Use strong, unique AUTH_SECRET in production
- Enable HTTPS in production for secure cookie transmission
- Consider implementing 2FA for additional security
- Monitor and log authentication events for security auditing
