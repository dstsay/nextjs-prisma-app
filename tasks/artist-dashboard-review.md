# Artist Dashboard Enhancement - Implementation Review

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented all requested features for the artist dashboard enhancement:

### 1. **Profile Image Display & Editing**
- Profile image displayed in a circle with hover effect
- Edit button underneath (mobile) and on hover (desktop)
- Modal upload interface using existing CloudinaryUpload component
- Automatic old image deletion when uploading new one

### 2. **Layout Design (Option 4 Selected)**
- Profile header at top showing artist info (similar to artist card)
- Tabbed interface below with three tabs:
  - Overview: Dashboard stats
  - Edit Profile: Profile editing form
  - Portfolio: Image management

### 3. **Portfolio Management**
- Grid display of portfolio images
- Add/remove functionality with 100 image limit
- 20MB file size restriction
- Cloudinary integration for uploads and deletions
- Security: Artists can only manage their own images

### 4. **Components Created**
- `ProfileHeader.tsx` - Artist info display with profile image
- `TabNavigation.tsx` - Reusable tab component
- `PortfolioManager.tsx` - Portfolio grid with add/remove
- `ProfileImageUpload.tsx` - Modal for profile image upload

### 5. **API Routes Created**
- `PUT /api/artist/profile-image` - Update profile image
- `POST /api/artist/portfolio` - Add portfolio image
- `DELETE /api/artist/portfolio/[index]` - Remove portfolio image

### 6. **Security Implementation**
- Authentication required on all routes
- Artist authorization (only artists can access)
- Artists can only modify their own content
- Input validation with Zod schemas

### 7. **Testing**
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for all API routes
- 47 tests total, all passing

### Files Modified/Created:
- `/app/artist/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated with new layout

The implementation follows all the project's coding standards, uses existing patterns, and maintains consistency with the codebase.
