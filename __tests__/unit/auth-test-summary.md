# Authentication Unit Tests Summary

## Test Results

### âœ… Passing Tests (18/18 Component Tests)

#### Component Tests
- **LoginForm Component** (7/7 tests passing)
  - Renders form with username and password fields
  - Calls signIn with correct credentials for both client and artist
  - Redirects to appropriate dashboard on success
  - Shows error messages on failed login
  - Properly disables form during loading
  - Shows loading spinner while signing in

- **SocialLoginButtons Component** (6/6 tests passing)
  - Renders all three SSO buttons (Google, Facebook, Apple)
  - Calls signIn with correct provider and callback URLs
  - Respects custom callback URLs when provided
  - Disables all buttons when one is loading
  - Shows loading spinner on clicked button

- **LogoutButton Component** (5/5 tests passing)
  - Renders logout button correctly
  - Calls signOut when clicked
  - Applies custom CSS classes
  - Shows loading state during logout
  - Handles logout errors gracefully

### ðŸ”§ Tests Requiring Environment Setup

#### Auth Helpers Tests
- Tests are written but require proper Next.js redirect mocking
- Cover getCurrentUser, requireAuth, role-based auth functions
- Test URL generation helpers

#### API Route Tests  
- Signup endpoint tests written
- Require proper request mocking setup

#### Middleware Tests
- Comprehensive route protection tests written
- Need Next.js middleware test environment

## Key Achievements

1. **Complete Test Coverage** for all authentication components
2. **Mocked Dependencies** properly (next-auth/react, navigation)
3. **Testing Best Practices** implemented:
   - Isolated unit tests
   - Proper mocking strategies
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Edge case coverage

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all auth component tests (currently passing)
npm test -- __tests__/unit/components/auth

# Run all auth tests (includes pending environment setup)
npm test -- auth

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage auth
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper test environment for Next.js server components
2. Add integration tests for complete auth flows
3. Add E2E tests for login/logout scenarios
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically
