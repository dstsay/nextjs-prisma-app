- Screen sharing capability placeholder
- Professional control layout

### 12. **Update email templates with video links** (Medium Priority)
- Added `sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail` function
- Client email includes mobile-friendly video join link
- Artist email includes desktop host link
- Both emails contain full appointment details

### 13. **Create unit tests for API routes** (Low Priority)
- Token generation tests
- Waiting status management tests
- Session control tests
- All tests passing with proper mocks

### 14. **Create unit tests for video components** (Low Priority)
- ClientWaitingRoom component tests
- EndSessionModal component tests
- Tests cover user interactions and state changes

### 15. **Create integration tests for video flow** (Low Priority)
- End-to-end consultation flow test
- Database integration verification
- Email notification testing

### 16. **Run build and fix any TypeScript errors** (High Priority)
- Fixed all import path issues
- Resolved TypeScript type errors
- Build completes successfully

### 17. **Run all existing tests to check for breaks** (High Priority)
- Updated test database schema
- Fixed breaking changes
- Identified pre-existing test failures unrelated to video implementation

## Pending Tasks üìã

### 18. **Test on mobile devices and desktop browsers** (Low Priority)
- Requires manual testing on actual devices
- Test iPhone Safari/Chrome for client experience
- Test desktop browsers for artist experience
- Verify responsive behavior

## Implementation Review üìù

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Twilio Video SDK** was chosen for enterprise reliability and mobile optimization
2. **Separate experiences** for mobile clients and desktop artists
3. **Waiting room pattern** implemented to match specified workflow
4. **10-minute early join window** enforced at API level

### Key Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first client experience with full-screen video
- ‚úÖ Desktop-optimized artist interface with controls
- ‚úÖ Waiting room with real-time status updates
- ‚úÖ Session lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ Email notifications with video links
- ‚úÖ Secure token generation with role-based access

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript types properly defined
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit and integration tests created
- Build passes without errors
- Following existing code patterns and conventions

### Security Considerations
- Token-based authentication for video access
- Role-based access control (artist vs client)
- Time-window restrictions
- Session state verification

### Areas for Future Enhancement
1. Add video recording functionality
2. Implement screen sharing for artists
3. Add connection quality indicators
4. Create video test/preview page
5. Add session analytics and reporting

### Dependencies Added
- `twilio`: ^5.8.0
- `twilio-video`: ^2.32.0
- `@types/twilio-video`: ^2.7.3

The implementation successfully delivers all requested features while maintaining code quality and following the project's established patterns.
